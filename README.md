# namewall-generator
openscad nametag generator for my twitch viewer wall

- nametaggenerator.scad
This is the main generator file

- makenametag.sh
In here the different steps for generating a nametag are defined and run in parallel to make use of multiple CPU cores

- nametags.sh
generates multiple nametags at once.

 - jotlogo.svg
 in case you want to generate a nametag from an SVG instead of fonts, this is also possible. This is an example file.
